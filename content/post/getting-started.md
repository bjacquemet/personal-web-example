We'll assume here that you have a good understanding of Hugo and its structure. If you have any doubt, check the (https://gohugo.io/documentation/)[Hugo documentation]; it is pretty good and the community quite active! (thanks so much by the way! :muscle:)

The first thing to do when starting your own website is to **copy the content of exampleSite** in your own root folder. This way, you can have a sample of `config.toml` file and a first structure.

Browse the articles in the `content/post` folder to get any help during setup or using the theme. Please, (https://baptistej.com)[contact me] if you have any problem using the them.

Then **configure the `config.toml` file** to match your need.

You should then write you home (`/content/_index.md`), create your first project (see `/content/post/portfolio-definition.md`) and your first blogpost.

Lastly, define the menu in the sidebar; you can get some help in the `/content/post/manage-your-menu.md` file.
